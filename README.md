# ⚡ Data Visualization Platform

A modern web application for visualizing and managing data related to **charging stations**, **fleet sizing**, and **parking**.  
Built with **React**, **TypeScript**, and **Vite**.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Modular component architecture (Cards, Navbar, Charts, Interactive Buttons/Badges, Sidebar, etc.)
- Pages for Charging Stations, Fleet Sizing, and Parking
- Responsive UI with reusable UI primitives
- State management using React hooks
- Shadcn for seamless and clean ui
- TypeScript for type safety
- Vite for fast development and optimized builds

---

## ⚙️ Technical Decisions & Trade-offs

- **Vite** selected for its blazing-fast development and build speed
- **TypeScript** used for type safety and developer tooling
- **Component-based architecture** enables reusability and clean code organization
- **No backend integration** in this version – easier deployment, but limited real-world interactivity
- **Minimal external dependencies** for more control and customization, at the cost of more initial effort

---

## 🚧 Known Limitations

- No backend/database – all data is static or mock
- Real-time updates not supported

---

## 📦 Setup Instructions
